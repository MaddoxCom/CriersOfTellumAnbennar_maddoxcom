Korgus asked\n\n\"You have proven your worth as a great warrior and a leader. Now let me reward you for it. You will take a place at my side, as the new god of war!"\n\nFor a few moments Korgus stood in silence, then, with visible determination and a sense of duty he uttered:\n\n\n\"My task is not yet done. I will not sit idly as my brothers and sisters fight. Father, if there's one thing I want more than to be by your side, it is to lead my brave warriors to battle, one last time!""
